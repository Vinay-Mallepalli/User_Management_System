The User Management System is a Java-based web application developed using JDBC, Servlet, and JSP technologies. 
We can manage the users by adding the new user, storing into the database and displaying on the webpage at the same time ans also we can edit and delete the user.
All the CRUD operations are performed on it (modified).
